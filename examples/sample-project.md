# Route Refactoring Project

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the application routing system. The current implementation uses a monolithic routing structure that is difficult to maintain and test. This refactoring will introduce a modular, hierarchical routing architecture with improved error handling and middleware support.

### Goals

- Improve route maintainability through modular structure
- Enhance error handling consistency across all endpoints
- Implement comprehensive middleware pipeline
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for routing logic
- Reduce technical debt by 40%

### Timeline

- Phase 1: 2 weeks (route extraction)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks (middleware implementation)
- Phase 3: 1 week (testing and validation)
- Total duration: 5 weeks

## Task 1: Extract Authentication Routes

### Overview

Extract all authentication-related routes from the monolithic router into a dedicated authentication module. This includes login, logout, registration, password reset, and token management endpoints.

### Requirements

1. Create new `routes/auth` package
2. Move authentication handlers to dedicated files
3. Implement authentication middleware
4. Update route registration to use new structure
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Implementation Details

The authentication module should expose a single `RegisterRoutes` function that takes a router group and registers all auth endpoints. This allows for clean separation and easy testing.

```go
// Example structure
package auth

func RegisterRoutes(group *router.Group) {
    group.POST("/login", handleLogin)
    group.POST("/logout", handleLogout)
    group.POST("/register", handleRegister)
}
```

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for each handler
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- Test authentication middleware with valid/invalid tokens
- Test rate limiting on login endpoints

### Dependencies

- Task 3 (middleware framework must be ready)
- Database migration for session storage

## Task 2: Extract User Management Routes

### Overview

Extract user profile, settings, and account management routes into a dedicated user management module. This includes CRUD operations for user data, profile updates, and account deletion.

### Requirements

1. Create `routes/users` package
2. Implement user authorization middleware
3. Add input validation for user data updates
4. Implement soft delete for account deletion
5. Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Implementation Details

User routes should be protected by both authentication and authorization middleware. Only users should be able to modify their own data, with admin override capability.

### Testing Requirements

- Test authorization for self vs. other user data
- Test input validation edge cases
- Test soft delete functionality
- Test audit log generation

## Task 3: Implement Middleware Framework

### Overview

Create a flexible middleware framework that supports before/after hooks, error handling, and context propagation. This framework will be used by all route groups.

### Components

#### Request Logger

Logs all incoming requests with:
- Timestamp
- HTTP method and path
- Response status code
- Response time
- Request ID for tracing

#### Error Handler

Standardized error handling:
- Convert internal errors to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Return consistent error response format
- Log errors with context
- Support error codes for client-side handling

#### Rate Limiter

Protect endpoints from abuse:
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- IP-based and user-based limiting
- Return appropriate headers (X-RateLimit-*)
- Support for rate limit bypass (admin users)

### Testing Requirements

- Test middleware execution order
- Test error propagation through middleware chain
- Test rate limiter with various scenarios
- Test context propagation between middleware

## Task 4: Implement API Versioning

### Overview

Introduce API versioning to support backward compatibility while allowing for future API evolution. Use URL path versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`).

### Requirements

1. Create version routing infrastructure
2. Support multiple API versions simultaneously
3. Implement version deprecation warnings
4. Document version differences
5. Create migration guide for v1 to v2

### Implementation Strategy

Use route groups for version isolation:

```go
v1 := router.Group("/api/v1")
v2 := router.Group("/api/v2")
```

### Deprecation Policy

- New versions supported for 12 months
- Deprecated versions receive 6 months notice
- Security updates for deprecated versions for 3 months post-notice

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test each route handler in isolation
- Mock dependencies (database, external services)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage

### Integration Testing

- Test complete request/response cycles
- Use real database with test fixtures
- Test middleware interactions
- Validate error handling end-to-end

### Performance Testing

- Load test critical endpoints
- Measure response times under load
- Test rate limiter effectiveness
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### Acceptance Criteria

- All unit tests passing
- Integration tests covering happy path and error cases
- Performance benchmarks meeting SLA requirements
- No regression in existing functionality

## Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Internal Testing

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run automated test suite
3. Manual testing by QA team
4. Performance baseline measurements

### Phase 2: Beta Rollout

1. Enable new routes for 10% of traffic
2. Monitor error rates and performance
3. Collect feedback from beta users
4. Fix any discovered issues

### Phase 3: Full Rollout

1. Enable for 50% of traffic
2. Monitor for 48 hours
3. Enable for 100% of traffic
4. Deprecate old routing implementation

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:
- Immediate traffic routing back to old implementation
- Root cause analysis
- Fix and re-test
- Schedule new rollout attempt

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics

- Request success rate (target: 99.9%)
- Average response time (target: <200ms)
- P95 response time (target: <500ms)
- Error rate (target: <0.1%)

### Alerts

- Error rate spike (>1% for 5 minutes)
- Response time degradation (P95 >1s for 5 minutes)
- Rate limit exceeded (sustained high rejection rate)

### Dashboards

- Real-time request metrics by endpoint
- Error breakdown by type and endpoint
- Response time percentiles
- Rate limiter statistics

## Post-Launch

### Documentation Updates

- Update API documentation with new structure
- Create developer guide for adding new routes
- Document middleware usage patterns
- Update troubleshooting guide

### Knowledge Transfer

- Conduct team walkthrough of new architecture
- Create video tutorial for common tasks
- Schedule Q&A sessions
- Update onboarding documentation

### Maintenance

- Regular review of error logs
- Performance optimization based on metrics
- Quarterly security review
- Dependency updates and security patches
